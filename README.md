# Obsolete & Useless
Apparently at the time I made this I wasn't aware about package managers and similar technologies, it was still fun to do.

Here is what I currently use (at the time I'm writing this, 24/09/2024):
Windows:
* winget
* UniGetUI

Linux:
* nala (apt front-end) for Debian
* dnf for Fedora
* pacman for Arch
